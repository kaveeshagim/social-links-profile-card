## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to apply the hover effect to the lists and a tags together to integrate the text color change

some css im proud of

```css
ul li {
  background: var(--Grey-700);
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

ul li a {
  display: block;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: var(--White);
  font-family: "Inter SemiBold", sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-size: 13px;
  padding: 10px 0;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn further about max-height and max-width css properties and experiment more with them to get a clearer understanding. For future enahncements of this challenge, i want to try to build a set of profile cards with interactive features
